# Phalanx

Arm yourself for battle with spades and clubs and shields against your opponent.

Phalanx is a head-to-head combat card game for two or more players utilizing a standard 52-card deck.

## Card Deck

**TL;DR**

> Easiest Starter Deck requires only the Number Cards (2-10) from a standard 52-card deck.

Phalanx is designed to be played using a standard 52-card deck.

The Numbered Cards are enough to get started and even those aren't all required. In play testing a subset containing bigger attackers with weaker defenders led to a fast-paced deck with bigger hits and cards cycling through the battlefield at a rapid click.

We'll go through advanced decks later as well as how to use the Face Cards, Ace, and Joker.

## Cards

**TL;DR** Phalanx gives bonuses to each suit either for attacking or defending. The defense and attack values are both the number printed on the cards with Ace being 1 and the Face Cards being 11. Joker has 0 attack/defense value.

Some basics about cards.

### Suits

**TL;DR**

> ♦ Diamonds shield cards
> ╰─── blocks twice if in front of a card
>
> ♥ Hearts shield player
> ╰─── blocks twice if in front of a player
>
> ♣ Clubs attack cards
> ╰─── doubles damage dealt to backrow cards
>
> ♠ Spades attack players
> ╰─── doubles damage dealt to player

Suits are the little symbols you see on each card. Odds are if you're reading this in English then what you're accustomed to is the [standard 52-card deck][1] which is comprised of red Diamonds and Hearts with black or blue Spades and Clubs. If not then no worries we'll be explaining what they are and how they're used.

Phalanx play is based on the four common suits giving each a bonus that affects play.

### Shields: ♥ Heart & ♦ Diamond

### Weapons: ♠ Spades & ♣ Clubs

### Numbered Cards

In Phalanx we refer to the cards with numbers on their face as Numbered Cards.

The only exception is when we're referring to the Ten Card in text like we're doing here. The Ten Card is represented with an upper-cased `T`. This is a common abbreviation and can be found in rules for other games.

```
╭───╮ ╭───╮ ╭───╮ ╭───╮ ╭───╮ ╭───╮ ╭───╮ ╭───╮ ╭───╮
│ ♦ │ │ ♥ │ │ ♣ │ │ ♠ │ │ ♦ │ │ ♥ │ │ ♠ │ │ ♦ │ │ ♥ │
│ 2 │ │ 3 │ │ 4 │ │ 5 │ │ 6 │ │ 7 │ │ 8 │ │ 9 │ │ T │
╰───╯ ╰───╯ ╰───╯ ╰───╯ ╰───╯ ╰───╯ ╰───╯ ╰───╯ ╰───╯
```

### Ace Card

In Phalanx the Ace Card is treated as a 1 defense/attack value card. It isn't included in our list of [Numbered Cards](#numbered-cards) because it doesn't have a number and because it has special rules.

```
╭───╮ ╭───╮ ╭───╮ ╭───╮
│ ♦ │ │ ♥ │ │ ♣ │ │ ♠ │
│ A │ │ A │ │ A │ │ A │
╰───╯ ╰───╯ ╰───╯ ╰───╯
```

The Ace Card is played like any other Numbered Card except for one important difference. It is invulnerable and thus can't be damaged by common attacks. It only shields or attacks for 1 point of damage it doesn't get removed after absorbing damage. This behavior can have advantages and disadvantages and will affect your strategy when deployed to your battlefield.

## Face Cards: Heroicals

Face Cards are can be put into play via normal deployment or via their Heroical Trait at a specific moment.

Regardless of how they enter the battlefield they each have a 11 attack/defense value when deployed.

Heroicals can be deployed to battle same as Numbered Cards. It is only their Heroical Trait that requires specific timing to be activated.

### Heroical Trait

If you have a Heroical card in your hand at the start of your opponent's turn, your may respond to your opponent's declaration to attack and activate one of your Heroical's ability.

Each Heroical has a special ability that enables it to jump into your battlefield by swapping places with any card deployed on your battlefield.

#### Heroical Trait Caveat

There are tradeoffs to consider when deciding how you want to play your Heroicals. Like in life sometimes a heroic feat has unintended consequences.

You are interrupting your opponent's _declaration_ to attack, not the attacker nor the target they have selected.

Once the Heroical card has completed its special ability your opponent _then_ declares the attacker and its target.

In the case your opponent selected an attacker or target before you activated your hero your opponent has the right to declare a different target once your Heroical trait action has completed.

## Special Cards

### Joker: Wild

### Face-down

This one is a little different since this describes a card that is turned face down so neither player can see the face value. Maybe it is good. Maybe it is bad. Only playing the game will tell.

```
╭───╮
│   │
│   │
╰───╯
```

Over the course of play there will be times we need to refer to cards that are face down. For example when referring to the draw pile or discard pile both of which are kept face down. Some cards have special rules that can cards to be put into play Face-down.

So when you see a card being described with no suit or letter then it is representing a Face-down card.
